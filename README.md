# Konoha
A nice online party Game

## Introdcution
Konoha is a 5 players party game inspired from Mafia also known as werwolf. and took naruto shippuden story as theme to name the roles of the players.

## How To Play Konoha ?
Konoha is played by two teams: the Akatuski and the Konoha. The game Client will act as a moderator, each player will have a certain identity and it will be assigned randomly by the game client. At the start of the game, each one will know his/her identity. but they can't know the other player true identity even the akatsuki team.

1. Akatsuki (Akatsuki team)
2. Orochimaru (Akatuski team)
3. Jinchuriki (Konoha Team)
4. Shinobi (Konoha Team)
5. Hokage (Konoha Team)

There are two phases: night and day. At night, Akatsuki members secretly perform special actions; during day, players discuss and argue. The akatsuki objective is to trick the konoha to elminate one of their members, and Konoha's objective is to detect the akatsuki. At the end of the day everyone should vote to eliminate one player. These phases alternate with each other until all Akatsuki have been eliminated (Konoha Win) or until the Akatsuki outnumbers the Konoha (Konoha Win).

## Roles and abilities
each player may be given roles with special abilities:

1. Akatsuki — an Akatsuki member who choose a player to eliminate every night
2. Orochimaru — an Akatsuki member who can choose a player's ability and use it on another player
3. Shinobi — a Konoha member who may protect a player from being killed every night
4. Hokage — a Konoha Member when he reveals himself his vote becomes = 2
5. Jinchiruki — a Konhoa member and has a power of innocence :)
